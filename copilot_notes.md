# Copilot Notes

## context intent specificity clarity

copilot uses the context of current tab so open relevant files.  import what you want to use so it knows what to use

describe the goal (what I'm looking to build) and be flexible as it may generate something completely different.  Provide examples.  

## examples

"build out a conference website add a speaker, a track and a talk make sure that the parent can't be deleted if there are children"

delete and reprompt code that needs change "abbreviation should be three uppercase letters"

variable names need to be clear not abbreviations.
