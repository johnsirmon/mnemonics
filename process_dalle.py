    Process DALL路E images in the specified directory.

    This function reads the image files in the './images' directory, extracts
    relevant information from the filenames using regular expressions, and
    renames the files based on the extracted data. It also stores the extracted
    data in a list of dictionaries.

        extracted_data (list): A list of dictionaries containing the extracted
        data from the image filenames. Each dictionary has the following keys:
            - 'generated_by': The first 6 characters of the 'llm_prompt' string.
            - 'date_generated': A datetime object representing the date and time
              extracted from the filename.
            - 'llm_prompt': The full 'llm_prompt' string extracted from the filename.
